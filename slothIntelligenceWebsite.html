			<p style="padding-left: 25%;">Sloth Intelligence is redefining the way data is analyzed in the medical field. Our team works to innovate software capable of tracking illness and diagnosing patients in real time.</p><br>
			<p style = "padding-left: 25%;"> Users may select options based on symptoms they have been or are currently experiencing and gain instantaneous results regarding what the illness might be. Additionally, it can help doctors and researchers track epidemics on a global scale so that they may not only treat, but actively prevent illness before it gets out of control.</p>

			<h1> How It Works</h1>
			<p>The solution to worldwide illness is simple. Sloth Intelligence utilizes a neural network. Over time, the neural network is able to learn and diagnose. If it is incorrect it will adapt, receive new data, and learn. Each time a page is loaded the neural network gets slightly more accurate. Each computer using Sloth Intelligence will help to strengthen the network. Every time the page is loaded the neural network gets a little bit more accurate. Over time, with each connected device the potential of this software becomes limitless. <br>
